## The signal hiring managers look for
Case studies should answer three questions quickly:
1. What was the business problem?
2. What did you personally own?
3. What changed because of your work?

## Recommended structure
### Context
Briefly explain team setup, constraints, and starting quality bar.

### Decisions
Describe the top 2-3 technical and product decisions and why alternatives were rejected.

### Outcome
Provide measurable effects: conversion, reliability, delivery speed, or support load.

### Reflection
Show what you would change with more time.

## Common anti-patterns
- Screenshots without impact metrics.
- Generic stack lists with no architecture rationale.
- Overly long intro sections before tangible evidence.
